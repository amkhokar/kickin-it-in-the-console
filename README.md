# Kickin' it in the Console

This is my personal blog meant to share my learning as I become a better web developer. I love to share and discuss ideas about web development, and this project was a way for me to do that while also learning new tools and design patterns. I named it " Kickin it in the Console " because I spend a lot of time experimenting with and learning JavaScript in the console.
